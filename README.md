# 🧠 Logistic Regression from Scratch using NumPy

This repository contains a complete implementation of **Logistic Regression** from scratch, without using any machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`. This project demonstrates a deep understanding of the core mathematical concepts behind binary classification, including the **sigmoid function**, **binary cross-entropy loss**, and **gradient descent optimization**.
